**Habit Tracker**

The Habit Tracker is a **Python-based project** designed to help individuals develop and maintain new habits effectively. 

Using the Pixela API, this habit tracker provides a seamless and structured approach to habit formation.

The **Key Features** of this project include:

1. _**Pixela API Integration**_:

The project uses the Pixela API to store and visualize habit-related data. Pixela is a versatile habit tracking platform that allows users to graphically represent their progress over time.

2. _**Requests Module:**_

The requests module is employed to handle HTTP requests, facilitating communication between the Python script and the Pixela API. This integration ensures a smooth flow of data for habit tracking.

3. _**Datetime Module:**_

The datetime module is utilized to manage dates and timestamps. It aids in tracking when a habit is initiated, updated, or skipped, providing a comprehensive timeline of habit-related activities.


**Functionality of this Project:**
**1. _Create and Track Habits:**_

Users can create new habits within the PyHabitTracker, specifying details such as habit name, target value, and frequency.

**2. _Daily Updates:**_

The tracker encourages users to log their daily progress by making updates through the Python script. This information is sent to the Pixela API, updating the habit graph accordingly.

**3. _Visualize Progress:**_

The Pixela website offers graphical representations of habit streaks and trends over time, motivating users to stay consistent in their habit-building journey.
